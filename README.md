# This is my first bigger React project derived from Bob Zirolls Basic React Course.

This project consists of a hangman game. The main goal is to guess the word before losing all the languages listed. Having only Assembly left means you lose. There is also a countdown mechanic which put the player under pressure in order to guess the right word in given time.

Have fun!
